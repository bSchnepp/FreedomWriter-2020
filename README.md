# FreedomWriter 2020
A fork of some project I made in high school,
to make it usage as a replacement for something like VS Codium.

A lot of the codebase is pretty bad compared to what I'd make now,
so probably something like 80% of it has to be thrown out the window.
But some of this stuff is good, and a perfectly fine foundation.
